          Hey there! I'm Pratik Jha, a passionate web developer, game creator,
          and tech enthusiast who loves turning ideas into reality through code.
          Whether it's building interactive websites, crafting games, or
          developing full-stack applications, I thrive on pushing my limits and
          learning something new every day. From front-end magic with React and
          Three.js to back-end power with Node.js, I enjoy creating smooth,
          high-performance, and visually engaging digital experiences. My
          journey isnâ€™t just about codingâ€”it's about problem-solving,
          creativity, and constantly evolving in the ever-changing world of
          tech. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me playing chess, solving
          Rubikâ€™s cubes, sketching, or diving deep into the mysteries of the
          universe. I believe in the philosophy that "Nothing is hard, only
          new"â€”with enough effort, any skill can be mastered. If you're looking
          for a dedicated, innovative, and ambitious developer, letâ€™s connect
          and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
